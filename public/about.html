<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Chirag Mehta, a first-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a strong passion for IoT, robotics, and programming. I have hands-on experience in C and Python and enjoy developing software solutions. Additionally, I use HTML to create engaging web-based projects.

One of my proudest achievements is developing an IoT-based project using Arduino Uno, which sparked my interest in combining hardware and software. I’m also a content creator and editor, running a YouTube channel, chiruYT, where I share diverse content. One of my videos has gained over 28,000 views, inspiring me to continue producing quality material.</p>

<p>In addition to content creation, I am a graphic designer, using my creativity to design visuals for my projects. I also have experience as an esports player, where I’ve learned the value of teamwork and strategic thinking.

I’m proactive, always eager to learn, and actively involved in my college’s club culture. I enjoy collaborating with peers on innovative projects and seeking new challenges to grow both personally and professionally.</p>

<p>Feel free to connect with me if you’d like to discuss IoT, robotics, content creation, design, or any exciting opportunities!</p>
